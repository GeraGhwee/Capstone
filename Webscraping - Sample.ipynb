Early in its history, a rebellion led by a 13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and the creation of an annual televised event known as the Hunger Games.

If there were never meant to be teams, and if this book didn't want to have \"just another love triangle\" ... then it shouldn't have had \"just another love triangle\". That's the way it is, I'm afraid. I am absolutely and utterly sick of love triangles, and what was worse about this one was the second I read Peeta's name and his history with Katniss, I knew it was going to be all about Katniss loving Peeta and Gale trying to muscle in.

Yes, it is also a poignant critique of reality TV and Western callousness about the catastrophes caused by industrialization in the developing world, but that, too, resonates with me in many ways because of its remarkably feminine voice.

I've said to a few people that if I wasn't married, I'd have to marry this book. :) I read the 400 page ARC in a less-than-24-hour time period (so quickly that it was never even on my \"currently reading\" shelf), which I've only done before with HP books, and I've just officially put the first book on my 2008 favorites shelf. I feel pretty safe in saying that if this isn't still my favorite book of the year when next January rolls around, that I'll eat a hat. As soon as I finished reading it, I turned around and read it a 2nd time, which I've never done before in my life. I loved all of Collins' GREGOR books, and think she's a wonderful writer, but she's ratcheted it up to another level with this one. Even though it's the first in a trilogy, this one definitely stands alone, and I'm not sure how she can keep it up for another 2 books, but I suppose it's possible (think: THE GIVER, although I loved GATHERING BLUE, and liked THE MESSENGER--HUNGER GAMES is much more brutal than THE GIVER, though). It's got some very meaty issues to chew on, not the least of which is reality TV taken to extremes. There's a chaste and unresolved romance (think: TWILIGHT, but I don't think I will make it past the first in that series--HUNGER GAMES has much more action, more of a plot, lots of well-developed secondary characters, as well as extremely likeable main characters. I will miss Katniss until I can read about her again.). What more could you possibly ask for out of a book? It doesn't actually come out until October 2008, but if you can get your hands on an ARC, definitely do! I think that the violence in this will be easier for kids to take, since they probably won't see it quite as clearly as an adult will. None of it is particularly graphic, but it is definitely brutal. This is on the edge of too dark for me, which is my favorite kind of book. There aren't many writers who can push it right to the edge for me without going over (Zusak comes to mind immediately), but Collins is definitely one of them. Another book that I loved, and think of to compare this to is HOUSE OF THE SCORPION, but that fell apart slightly at the end for me. HUNGER GAMES didn't lack anything at all for me. OK, I'll stop gushing. I may have to re-write this review when I get some perspective. (2012: Obviously, I never did rewrite it, and this is my most-\"liked\" review :)\n",

I ate it up, shouting into other rooms and offices that I was going to be shoving the book into their hands as soon as I was done, but as it went on desha vu was a little too common for me. I know there are major story types out there, ones that are repeated over and over again. Shakespeare retold 200 different ways. The bible reinterpreted to 2,000,000 varieties of tales....but when it comes to YA dystopia, which is by far my favorite genre of any book, originality is one of my main ways I judge a book. FEED felt utterly original. The world of UGLIES felt new. LITTLE BROTHER was just plain amazing. If it's going to be about \"the future\" we don't know about, make it original. In my mind dystopia novels survive on \"idea\" more than \"excecution\" and while the execution of this was beautiful, the idea was hardly new.\n",

      "                        While I have a really good feeling Collins never read, or maybe even heard of, Battle Royale, The Hunger Games was 90% the plot of Battle Royal, minus the guns, the extra blood, the ability to get to know all the other players. In Battle Royal (short explanation of BR plot: 40 students put on island forced to kill each other and winner is set for life and put on TV etc...), the main focus is a love story between two students trapped in the game, two students bonding together with no real urge to kill others...one of whom had a crush on the other forever and it is only revealed during the game. There are so many other similarities, from the ways the gamemakers manipulate, to the ways the media encourages, to one character having a fever and the other taking care of them with soup. There are even \"career\" battle royal players. In BR you see the emotions before and after someone is killed, their last thoughts, the feeling of the person who killed. It's actually really beautiful the way it is done, and so believable that put in an arena teens WOULD turn into savages. In The Hunger Games, yes the main characters were fantastic, and many of the lesser as well, but Foxface is only Foxface, and the Careers are never more than random 1-dimensional bad guys.\n",

Amazing what subtracting guns can do to a story. Suddenly it doesn't feel as violent, but rather is more reminiscent of stories we heard growing up. The number of swords and arrow deaths in traditional fairytales is nothing to freak out about, but if bullets are flying, it will give \"too many ideas\" to teens and therefore must be dubbed an adult book.\n",

Ever since her father died the girl has spent her time saving her mother and little sister Prim from starvation by hunting on forbidden land. But worst of all is reaping day. Once a year the government chooses two children from each of the twelve districts to compete against one another in a live and televised reality show. Twenty-four kids and teens enter, and only one survives. When Prim's name is called, Katniss exchanges herself without hesitation to compete alongside the baker’s boy Peeta. To survive in this game you need to win the heart of your audience, and so District 12’s trainers come up with a plan. Why not make it as if Peeta and Katniss were in love with one another? But in a game where only one person can live, Katniss will have to use all her brains, wits, and instincts to determine who to trust and how to outwit the game's creators.\n",

Some of the greatest works of literature out there, regardless of the readerships' age, comes about when an author takes overdone or familiar themes and then makes them entirely new through the brilliance of their own writing. Harry Potter wouldn’t have been any great shakes if it weren’t for Rowling’s storytelling. Similarly, Collins takes ideas that have certainly seen the light of day before and concocts an amazingly addictive text. About the time you get to the fifth chapter that ends with a sentence that forces you to read on, you’re scratching your head wondering how the heck she\n",

Because basically it is a very hard thing to create a “good” person on the page that your reader is going to fall in love with. Because we readers know that we are flawed, we are often inclined to side with the similarly flawed people we meet between a book’s covers. Katniss, on the other hand, is so good in so many ways. She sacrifices herself for her sister. She tries to save people in the game. But there’s almost a jock mentality to her too. Katniss can figure out the puzzles and problems in the game, but when it comes to emotional complexity she’s sometimes up a tree. Most remarkable to me was the fact that Katniss could walk around, oblivious to romance, and not bug me. Seriously, nothing gets under my skin faster than heroines who can’t see that their fellow fellas are jonesing for them. You just want to bonk the ladies upside the head with a brick or something. The different here is maybe the fact that since Katniss knows that Peeta has to play a part, she uses that excuse (however unconsciously) to justify his seeming affection for her.

The words pop off the page. And then there’s the fact that we’re dealing with a dystopian novel where the author has somehow managed to create a believable future. No faux slang here, or casual references to extinct dolphins. There are some animals that were scientifically altered, but you can’t have a future without a couple cool details like that, right?\n",

There’s strategy, the world’s most fabulous fashion designer, weapons and a girl who knows how to fight. This is not a book that quietly slots into our preconceived stereotypes. And you know what happens to books that span genders? They sell very well indeed. That is, if you can get both boys and girls to read them.\n",

      "                                The age range? Well, for most of this story I would have said ten and up. I mean, yeah the basic premise is that a lot of teenagers go around killing one another, and sure there’s some romance to deal with, but none of it really seems inappropriate... until a final death scene appears in the book. I won’t give any details, but suffice it to say it is gruesome. There are definite horror elements to it as well, so with that in mind I am upping my recommendation to 12 and up. I’m sure that there are 10-year-olds out there who’ve seen much worse stuff on cable, just as there are 12-year-olds who’ll freak out ten pages in. Still, I’m more comfortable recommending it for the older kids rather than the younger. You'll see why.\n",

      "                                  It occurs to me that there has never been a quintessential futuristic gladiator book for kids. That is undoubtedly the roughest term you can give this book. Now I’m not a person who cries easily when she reads something, particularly something for kids. Yet as I was taking a train to Long Island I found myself tearing up over significant parts of this story. It’s good. And it’s so ridiculous that a work of science fiction like this could even be so good. You think of futuristic arena tales and your mind instantly sinks to the lowest common denominator. What Collins has done here is set up a series that will sink its teeth into readers. The future of this book will go one of two ways. Either it will remain an unappreciated cult classic for years to come or it will be fully appreciated right from the start and lauded. My money lies with the latter. A contender in its own right.\n",

Love triangles seem to have chased me and hunted me down with every YA read I picked up over the last two or three years - my dislike for romance instantly becoming doubled by the introduction of yet another boy with beautiful eyes.

She falls, she fails, people get hurt because of her and she has to live with that. We love her and yet she's antisocial, awkward and moody. She loves other people with all her heart but she's not much of a team player. In short: she's a complex portrait of a young woman that doesn't fall into any neatly defined boxes or categories. Now, perhaps, authors have since tried to recreate her. But she's still one of the first and best.\n",

You're just taken there. You're not drawn in. You don't have to do anything. You just sit there and your stomach flops over and over as opposed to your mind working, thinking, puzzling, imagining. The writing style wasn't even good, and the grammar was actually quite poor. What really annoyed me about the writing style was that I knew paragraphs before if something exciting was going to happen. Just the way that Suzanne Collins wrote blew away the whole surprise and shock of an attack.\n",

But she never really got to the point. She focused instead on entertaining us, on giving us a sob story. There was so much potential in this book. What I'm trying to say is that there was so much that Suzanne Collins could have done to make this book a masterpiece like Fahrenheit 451. But she just didn't.\n",

These televised games are then broadcast throughout Panem (with mandatory viewing) as the 24 contestants fight each other to the death, leaving just one victor at its violent conclusion. It’s kind of like Survivor but instead of being voted off the island you have to kill your competitors. When Katniss’s younger sister is chosen as the female contestant from their district Katniss volunteers to take her place. Then together with Peeta the other lottery winner they travel to the capital and begin preparations for the opening ceremonies and ultimately their death in The Hunger Games.\n",

However as soon as the games begin, lookout! By this point in the story you have become attached to several key characters and its then that you realize things can’t end well as there will be only one winner. Over a period of about 2 weeks and against overwhelming odds we watch 24 victims dwindle as they struggle to survive. Simultaneously avoiding and hunting each other they form alliances, face hunger and mind numbing thirst, mutant animal attacks, friendship, love and ultimately a distrust of everyone as Big Brother raises the stakes to keep the audience interested.\n",

The book shows, throughout the story, a somewhat futuristic dystopia society. The tributes (Katniss, Peeta and others in the game) are given basic weapons (bows, spears, clubs) and the district where Katniss is from uses herbs and eats basic foods (squirrel, wild turkey, etc) but the capitol has voice command room service, automatic hair dryers, and a camera/screen set that tracks and shows the tributes (no matter where they go) to the viewers.

Everything, from Katniss's first spring into the trees to the final scene when the remaining two tributes defy the Games, was unnecessary and revolting. It's not the murders that disappointed me; I went into the story knowing that at least twenty people would die in the book. No, what truly revolted me was that the competition was meant to be entertaining - not just to the vain audiences in the corrupted society, but to us readers, as well. So much of it was written in a way that we would find it appealing... imagine, finding death appealing.\n",

This is not necessarily a lottery you would want to win, as the Hunger Games contest is a gladiatorial battle to the death. Joining an ancient form of barbarity with a more modern version, the contest is seen by the nation on television, gussied up with all the pomp and circumstance of the World Cup, Superbowl and World Series combined, with the degrading intrusiveness of reality television.\n",

The rest is their ordeal, which includes having to succeed not only with physical skills such as strength and agility. In addition to the need for cunning in figuring out how to best their competitors, they have to figure out how to please the television audience, among which are sponsors who might send them much needed goods during the game.\n",

      "                    Ok, I liked the book. But I had a niggling concern early on. When I began reading, I wondered if there might be a political agenda at play. The “Capitol” is clearly the evil tyrant here, with the oppressed working people living in dread of their overlords. Had this story been published in the early-to-mid 20th century, one might presume that the “Capitol” stood in for the fascism of Germany, Italy or Spain, or the totalitarianism of the Soviet Union/Russia or China. However, given the political climate of the twenty-teens, in which cynical forces of the right seek at every opportunity to portray government of any sort as the personification of evil, one must wonder if the author subscribed to the notion. I confess to not having read her prior work, so lack a basis there, and the interviews with Collins I read offer no insight. So, I am not saying that this is so, just that the portrayal made me wonder. I will read more of Collins’ work and look into the subject some more outside pages she wrote, and if I find anything definitive I will update this entry.\n",

Smart, fast, and wise to the ways of the networked world, he has no trouble outwitting his high school’s intrusive but clumsy surveillance systems.\\n\\nBut his whole world changes when he and his friends find themselves caught in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack on San Francisco. In the wrong place at the wrong time, Marcus and his crew are apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security and whisked away to a secret prison where they’re mercilessly interrogated for days.\\n\\nWhen the DHS finally releases them, his injured best friend Darryl does not come out. The city has become a police state where every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist. He knows that no one will believe his story, which leaves him only one option: &quot;M1k3y&quot; will take down the DHS himself.<\\/span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\"7005680577535377129\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\">...more<\\/a>\\n\\n    <\\/div>\\n\\n      <div class=\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\' id=\\'10_book_954674\\'>\\n<div class=\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\'>\\n<form action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"cxfUC4DnuEawn9fERYW2LXO7Db8iINWFemhL/6DBPE0aA9hivZMyGnUWc5EjrG/89tFkbcRGWyOPIDPppjgNcg==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"954674\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"to-read\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"10_book_954674\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"wtr_new\\\" id=\\\"wtr_new\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"ref\\\" id=\\\"ref\\\" value=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"existing_review\\\" id=\\\"existing_review\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"wtrExisting\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games\\\" />\\n<button class=\\'wtrToRead\\' type=\\'submit\\'>\\n<span class=\\'progressTrigger\\'>Want to Read<\\/span>\\n<span class=\\'progressIndicator\\'>saving…<\\/span>\\n<\\/button>\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\'>\\n<form class=\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\" action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"cKK6a0EDek13uRTgDcGjyn0rgYrWvviE7JTlC1xfqWQZtrYCfHfwEbIwsLVr6Hob+EHoWDDYdiIZ3J0dWqaYWw==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"10_book_954674\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"954674\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"a\\\" id=\\\"a\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games\\\" />\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<button class=\\'wtrShelfButton\\'><\\/button>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\'>\\n<div class=\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\'>\\nError rating book.

The Wrecker civilization has long been destroyed, leaving only landfills for Saba and her family to scavenge from. That\\'s fine by her, as long as her beloved twin brother Lugh is around. But when four cloaked horsemen capture Lugh, Saba\\'s world is shattered, and she embarks on a quest to get him back.\\nSuddenly thrown into the lawless, ugly reality of the outside world, Saba discovers she is a fierce fighter, an unbeatable survivor, and a cunning opponent. Teamed up with a handsome daredevil named Jack and a gang of girl revolutionaries called the Free Hawks, Saba\\'s unrelenting search for Lugh stages a showdown that will change the course of her own civilization.<\\/span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\"16934256771131067199\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\">...more<\\/a>\\n\\n    <\\/div>\\n\\n      <div class=\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\' id=\\'11_book_9917938\\'>\\n<div class=\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\'>\\n<form action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"Y4zlut3h8oVK8GR2v8IQh58qrbaUJA1k0sGQuJ/TlbwKmOnT4JV42Y95wCPZ68lWGkDEZHJCg8InieiumSqkgw==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"9917938\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"to-read\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"11_book_9917938\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"wtr_new\\\" id=\\\"wtr_new\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"ref\\\" id=\\\"ref\\\" value=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"existing_review\\\" id=\\\"existing_review\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"wtrExisting\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games\\\" />\\n<button class=\\'wtrToRead\\' type=\\'submit\\'>\\n<span class=\\'progressTrigger\\'>Want to Read<\\/span>\\n<span class=\\'progressIndicator\\'>saving…<\\/span>\\n<\\/button>\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\'>\\n<form class=\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\" action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"RFtjIqfC1CtulfVp7TWgGeHr2LkKoaDrkI3BGXI022ktT29LmrZed6scUTyLHHnIZIGxa+zHLk1lxbkPdM3qVg==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"11_book_9917938\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"9917938\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"a\\\" id=\\\"a\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games\\\" />\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<button class=\\'wtrShelfButton\\'><\\/button>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\'>\\n<div class=\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\'>\\nError rating book.

Or so he believes...\\n\\nFiercely loyal to the Queen and Finnikin, Froi has been trained roughly and lovingly by the Guard sworn to protect the royal family, and has learned to control his quick temper.

But that safety proves fleeting when rogue forces in the Clave plot to see her protector, Charlotte, replaced as head of the Institute. If Charlotte loses her position, Tessa will be out on the street—and easy prey for the mysterious Magister, who wants to use Tessa’s powers for his own dark ends.\\n\\nWith the help of the handsome, self-destructive Will and the fiercely devoted Jem, Tessa discovers that the Magister’s war on the Shadowhunters is deeply personal. He blames them for a long-ago tragedy that shattered his life. To unravel the secrets of the past, the trio journeys from mist-shrouded Yorkshire to a manor house that holds untold horrors, from the slums of London to an enchanted ballroom where Tessa discovers that the truth of her parentage is more sinister than she had imagined. When they encounter a clockwork demon bearing a warning for Will, they realize that the Magister himself knows their every move—and that one of their own has betrayed them.\\n\\nTessa finds her heart drawn more and more to Jem, but her longing for Will, despite his dark moods, continues to unsettle her. But something is changing in Will—the wall he has built around himself is crumbling. Could finding the Magister free Will from his secrets and give Tessa the answers about who she is and what she was born to do?\\n\\nAs their dangerous search for the Magister and the truth leads the friends into peril, Tessa learns that when love and lies are mixed, they can corrupt even the purest heart.<\\/span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\"15820431870641955873\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\">...more<\\/a>\\n\\n    <\\/div>\\n\\n      <div class=\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\' id=\\'15_book_10025305\\'>\\n<div class=\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\'>\\n<form action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"6grMkoMJEXKr9RJCUbbcyCfDv+fTK+ChKF2RDoXw9JGDHsD7vn2bLm58thc3nwUZoqnWNTVNbgfdFekYgwnFrg==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"10025305\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"to-read\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"15_book_10025305\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"wtr_new\\\" id=\\\"wtr_new\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"ref\\\" id=\\\"ref\\\" value=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"existing_review\\\" id=\\\"existing_review\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"wtrExisting\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games\\\" />\\n<button class=\\'wtrToRead\\' type=\\'submit\\'>\\n<span class=\\'progressTrigger\\'>Want to Read<\\/span>\\n<span class=\\'progressIndicator\\'>saving…<\\/span>\\n<\\/button>\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\'>\\n<form class=\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\" action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"LKuPkQZFwxJp/6n07Xk6DCtts68epyVg70sqH/EYrxtFv4P4OzFJTqx2DaGLUOPdrgfaffjBq8YaA1IJ9+GeJA==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"15_book_10025305\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"10025305\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"a\\\" id=\\\"a\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games\\\" />\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<button class=\\'wtrShelfButton\\'><\\/button>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\'>\\n<div class=\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\'>\\nError rating book.

In addition to proving herself worthy of being a page, Kel spends her time defending first-year pages from bullies, staying on top of homework, conquering her paralyzing fear of heights, and keeping up with Lord Wyldon\\'s grueling physical training schedule. Kel\\'s detractors do everything in their power to thwart her progress, from tormenting her friends to sabotaging the Midwinter Festivities to kidnapping her maid and dog on the day of final examinations. The tide of resistance begins to turn slightly during the summer between Kel\\'s second and third years, when she leads a team of pages in defensive maneuvers against renegade bandits--coincidentally on the same day that she gets her first period.<\\/span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\"7947719611562779080\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\">...more<\\/a>\\n\\n    <\\/div>\\n\\n      <div class=\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\' id=\\'16_book_153785\\'>\\n<div class=\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\'>\\n<form action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"p4Q6uoL16JHXSwMKnJVPOtmLr1xLj+XjzvbleZ2Z8z3OkDbTv4FizRLCp1/6vJbrXOHGjq3pa0U7vp1vm2DCAg==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"153785\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"to-read\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"16_book_153785\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"wtr_new\\\" id=\\\"wtr_new\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"ref\\\" id=\\\"ref\\\" value=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"existing_review\\\" id=\\\"existing_review\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"wtrExisting\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games\\\" />\\n<button class=\\'wtrToRead\\' type=\\'submit\\'>\\n<span class=\\'progressTrigger\\'>Want to Read<\\/span>\\n<span class=\\'progressIndicator\\'>saving…<\\/span>\\n<\\/button>\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\'>\\n<form class=\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\" action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"tCU1JLfGyD5BbIvHX0A0vKvXz14ZdDVj1bbqNLQSYZ/dMTlNirJCYoTlL5I5ae1tLr2mjP8Su8Ug/pIisutQoA==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"16_book_153785\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"153785\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"a\\\" id=\\\"a\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games\\\" />\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<button class=\\'wtrShelfButton\\'><\\/button>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\'>\\n<div class=\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\'>\\nError rating book.

Tad Beaumont, the hottest boy in town, has even asked Suze out on her very first date.

Your emails, your reviews, your comments on my website, every ounce of your enthusiasm . . . it has combined to grant me enough satisfaction and confidence to last the rest of my writing days.\\n\\nFor those of you who suffered the wait, I hope you\\'ll find it was worth it.

Evil is bad that believes it’s good.” — MacKayla Lane was just a child when she and her sister, Alina, were given up for adoption and banished from Ireland forever. — Twenty years later, Alina is dead and Mac has returned to the country that expelled them to hunt her sister’s murderer. But after discovering that she descends from a bloodline both gifted and cursed, Mac is plunged into a secret history: an ancient conflict between humans and immortals who have lived concealed among us for thousands of years.\\n\\nWhat follows is a shocking chain of events with devastating consequences, and now Mac struggles to cope with grief while continuing her mission to acquire and control the Sinsar Dubh -- a book of dark, forbidden magic scribed by the mythical Unseelie King, containing the power to create and destroy worlds.\\n\\nIn an epic battle between humans and Fae, the hunter becomes the hunted when the Sinsar Dubh turns on Mac and begins mowing a deadly path through those she loves.\\n\\nWho can she turn to?

In order to see her sister again, Gaia must submit to their strict social code and the oppressive rules of Matrarc Olivia. Meanwhile, two brothers claim her attention as they attempt to understand the environmental trap that keeps the people of Sylum captive, and suddenly Gaia must contend with the exciting, uncomfortable, and altogether new feeling of being desired.\\n\\nBut when someone from her past shows up, Gaia discovers that survival alone is not enough and that justice requires sacrifice.<\\/span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\"16495998982646697103\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\">...more<\\/a>\\n\\n    <\\/div>\\n\\n      <div class=\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\' id=\\'22_book_9424367\\'>\\n<div class=\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\'>\\n<form action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"SdgpVc/rZWEUo1KsAbK/JWKTfCDTA+mFXUTM4z8fibQgzCU88p/vPdEq9vlnm2b05/kV8jVlZyOoDLT1Oea4iw==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"9424367\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"to-read\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"22_book_9424367\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"wtr_new\\\" id=\\\"wtr_new\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"ref\\\" id=\\\"ref\\\" value=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"existing_review\\\" id=\\\"existing_review\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"wtrExisting\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games\\\" />\\n<button class=\\'wtrToRead\\' type=\\'submit\\'>\\n<span class=\\'progressTrigger\\'>Want to Read<\\/span>\\n<span class=\\'progressIndicator\\'>saving…<\\/span>\\n<\\/button>\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\'>\\n<form class=\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\" action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"/ugS8G+tSbRe7K9q1q3qqiwbKbZOA3FyLQRqNKUIeGKX/B6ZUtnD6JtlCz+whDN7qXFAZKhl/9TYTBIio/FJXQ==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"22_book_9424367\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"9424367\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"a\\\" id=\\\"a\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games\\\" />\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<button class=\\'wtrShelfButton\\'><\\/button>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\'>\\n<div class=\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\'>\\nError rating book.

After the initial shock of waking up in a cemetery and being told that she has been missing for weeks - with no one knowing where she was or who she was with - she tried to get her life back on track. Go to school, hang out with her best friend, Vee, and dodge mom\\'s creepy new boyfriend.\\n\\nBut there is this voice in the back of her head, an idea that she can almost reach out and touch.

I swore it was like I could hear Robert whispering in my ear: The world of the dead won\\'t give you up a second time. Just before the light completely vanished, I saw Dimitri\\'s face join Lissa\\'s. I wanted to smile. I decided then that if the two people I loved most were safe, I could leave this world.\\n\\nThe dead could finally have me.\\n\\n\\nRose Hathaway has always played by her own rules. She broke the law when she ran away from St. Vladimir\\'s Academy with her best friend and last surviving Dragomir princess, Lissa. She broke the law when she fell in love with her gorgeous, off-limits instructor, Dimitri. And she dared to defy Queen Tatiana, leader of the Moroi world, risking her life and reputation to protect generations of dhampir guardians to come.\\n\\nNow the law has finally caught up with Rose - for a crime she didn\\'t even commit. She\\'s in prison for the highest offense imaginable: the assassination of a monarch. She\\'ll need help from both Dimitri and Adrian to find the one living person who can stall her execution and force the Moroi elite to acknowledge a shocking new candidate for the royal throne: Vasilisa Dragomir.\\n\\nBut the clock on Rose\\'s life is running out.

She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.\\n\\nMuch to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she\\'s afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she\\'s not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol\\'s cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can\\'t prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.\\n\\nIn Catching Fire, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.<\\/span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\"3014119212539071972\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\">...more<\\/a>\\n\\n    <\\/div>\\n\\n      <div class=\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\' id=\\'26_book_6148028\\'>\\n<div class=\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\'>\\n<form action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"QxTYd0mMaxKIxlA9NHITWttPVJfwaB/EUQSN2uXkoo4qANQedPjhTk1P9GhSW8qLXiU9RRYOkWKkTPXM4x2TsQ==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"6148028\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"to-read\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"26_book_6148028\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"wtr_new\\\" id=\\\"wtr_new\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"ref\\\" id=\\\"ref\\\" value=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"existing_review\\\" id=\\\"existing_review\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"wtrExisting\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"series_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games\\\" />\\n<button class=\\'wtrToRead\\' type=\\'submit\\'>\\n<span class=\\'progressTrigger\\'>Want to Read<\\/span>\\n<span class=\\'progressIndicator\\'>saving…<\\/span>\\n<\\/button>\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\'>\\n<form class=\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\" action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"diY/cQplpDhISuKExa37NstntuXbINRDwcJjjZRtWo4fMjMYNxEuZI3DRtGjhCLnTg3fNz1GWuU0ihubkpRrsQ==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"26_book_6148028\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"6148028\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"a\\\" id=\\\"a\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"series_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games\\\" />\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<button class=\\'wtrShelfButton\\'><\\/button>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\'>\\n<div class=\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\'>\\nError rating book.

District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol.

      "How to Eat Fried Worms\n",
      "Fans of Diary of a Wimpy Kid, The Worst Class Trip Ever, and the Tapper Twins series \"will revolt and delight\" in How to Eat Fried Worms. Because of a bet, Billy is in the uncomfortable position of having to eat fifteen worms in fifteen days. The worms are supplied by his opponent, whose motto is \"The bigger and juicier, the better!\" At first Billy's problem is whether or not he can swallow the worm placed before him, even with a choice of condiments from peanut butter to horseradish. But later it looks as if Billy will win, and the challenge becomes getting to the worm to eat it. Billy's family, after checking with the doctor, takes everything in stride. They even help Billy through his gastronomic ordeal, which twists and turns with each new day, leaving the outcome of the bet continually in doubt. This edition also includes an eight-page full color insert with photos from the movie!\n",
